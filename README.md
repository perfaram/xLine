Easy-to-use command-line utility to get system informations, such as component temperature or battery data (will come back soon).
You can also make raw requests to your Macintosh's SMC, using `-s TC0P`, where TC0P (currently, the CPU temperature) can be replaced by whatever you want (see https://github.com/perfaram/xLine/blob/master/SMC_Keys.md)
